# Hola!

👋🏼 𝗪𝗛𝗢 𝗜 𝗔𝗠
- 👩🏻‍💻 ︱ My name is Cristina and I'm a junior software engineer.
- 👩🏻‍🎓 ︱ I am a graduate of The Grace Hopper Program at Fullstack Academy. 
- 🍎 ︱ Before pivoting software engineering, my path was centered around elementary school education. Most recently, I worked as a bilingual 5th-grade teacher!
- 🥾 ︱ Fun fact: I am an enthusiastic hiker and have been training to hike the Grand Canyon's Bright Angel Trail all 14 miles down to the Colorado River!

🙌🏼 𝗠𝗜𝗦𝗦𝗜𝗢𝗡 & 𝗩𝗜𝗦𝗜𝗢𝗡

I enjoy challenging myself as a software engineer at innovative, solutions-driven organizations focused on transforming our educational landscape. I am passionate about leveraging EdTech to benefit our students and their families and am excited to be a part of the change I hope to see!
